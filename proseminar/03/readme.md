# Assignment 3

The goal of this assignment is to try some MPI debugging.

## Exercise 1 (2 Points)

### Tasks

- Take a look at the provided example codes.
- For each example code, run through the usual debugging workflow
    1) enable compiler warnings
    2) check with sanitizers
    3) run with a debugging tool of your choice (a working installation of MUST on LCC3 is provided in `/scratch/c703429/software/must-1.9.1`)
- Regardless of whether any of these steps highlights an issue, elaborate on the settings/parameters you used and what kind of errors they should detect!
- Report any bugs or issues that were found and attempt to fix them
- Is there anything else that can be done to highlight or avoid bugs?
- If you have time, use the same debugging workflow for one/some of your own implementations that exhibited strange behavior and see if you can spot any issues!

## Exercise 2 (1 Point)

- Try to debug the example codes but this time using your AI tool of choice.
- Report any bugs or issues that were found and how AI attempted to fix them. Report which tool you used along with your prompts (give as much information as possible with common sense).
